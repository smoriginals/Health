                                These are small lumps that form underneath the skin around the anus.
                                They are very itchy and painful. Usually, bleeding is present in this case.

                                and bulge outside the anus. These may bleed or cause severe pain.

                                They typically appear as a hard lump on the anus, which can be painful
