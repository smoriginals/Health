                            <strong>Haemorrhoidectomy:</strong> Doctors remove the swollen veins in the anus or rectum that cause piles. Usually done for large or protruding piles and requires general anaesthesia.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Stapled Haemorrhoidectomy:</strong> Uses a stapling device to cut off blood flow to the piles and reposition them inside the anus. Less painful than traditional surgery but may not be suitable for all types of piles.
                        </li>

                            <strong>Haemorrhoidal Artery Ligation:</strong> A minimally invasive procedure where ultrasound is used to locate and tie off blood vessels supplying the piles, causing them to shrink. Generally used for grade-1 piles.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Laser Surgery for Piles:</strong> A laser beam is used to cut off the blood supply to the piles, causing them to shrink and disappear. It is quick and relatively painless.
